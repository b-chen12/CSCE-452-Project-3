# CSCE-452-Project-3

# WIP (I think this works): To add the file to your ROS2 package
# First go into ~/ros2_ws/src and run the following:

```bash
colcon build
```

# After that go back to the ~/ros2_ws folder and run the following:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

# To see if that worked you can run the following command:

```bash
ros2 pkg list
```

# If you can find the project3 package in the list then this worked!
